# *** Some NetHackDS Specific options ***

# the hero are mapped to a compass, and translated to movement keys.  A value
# of 2 enables absolute mode, where the taps are examined relative to
# the center of the screen.  See the iRogue website for examples of how this 
# works.

# Enables some additional map colouring for special areas.
# OPTIONS=mapcolors
